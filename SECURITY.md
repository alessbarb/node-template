## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Contact Us**: Send an email to [github@labrynx.com](mailto:github@labrynx.com) detailing the vulnerability. Please include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any relevant technical details that can help us understand and address the issue.

2. **Response Time**: We strive to respond to security vulnerability reports promptly. You can expect an initial response acknowledging your report within 24 hours.

3. **Assessment**: Our security team will assess the vulnerability to determine its validity and severity. This may involve further communication with you to clarify details.

4. **Fix and Disclosure**: If the vulnerability is accepted and confirmed, we will work on a fix. Once a fix is ready, we will follow a coordinated disclosure process, which includes:
   - Preparing a security patch for the affected versions.
   - Coordinating the release of the patch across our supported versions.
   - Planning a disclosure date to minimize the risk of exploitation.

5. **Credit**: We believe in giving credit where it's due. If you're the first to report a vulnerability that is successfully validated and fixed, we will acknowledge your contribution in our release notes or security advisory.

6. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, providing credit to the reporter if requested.

Please note that we do not support or encourage any malicious activities, and we expect all reporters to follow responsible disclosure practices. We reserve the right to decline reports that are not aligned with responsible disclosure practices.

Thank you for your collaboration in making our project more secure.
